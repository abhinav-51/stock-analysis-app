# stock-analysis-app
A modular Streamlit-based Stock Analysis App with company dashboard, technical indicators, and machine-learning powered stock price prediction.


# 📊 Modular Stock Analysis App

A modular and interactive **Streamlit-based Stock Analysis Application** built in three phases:
1. **Company Dashboard**
2. **Technical Analysis**
3. **Stock Price Prediction (ML Model)**

This project allows users to visualize stock data, analyze trends using technical indicators, and forecast future prices with machine-learning techniques.
